A Forecast Vs Actual Work Order Hours KPI Dashboard in Power BI.

# Detailed process breakdown
KPI Definition and Calculation Method:

Defined the KPI by comparing the planned hours against the actual hours. This included setting up calculated columns to determine the percentage and absolute difference between planned and actual hours.

Data Model Setup:

Created and structured the data model to support the KPI calculations. This involved organizing the data to facilitate accurate and efficient analysis.

Calculated Columns:

Planned vs. Actual Hours Difference %: Calculated the percentage difference between planned and actual hours.
Planned vs. Actual Hours Absolute Difference %: Determined the absolute percentage difference.
Planned vs. Actual Hours Absolute Difference % within Limits: Evaluated if the absolute difference fell within predefined tolerance limits.
Measures:

% of Work Orders Meeting Planning Accuracy: Measured the percentage of work orders that met the planned accuracy criteria.
% of Work Orders Planned Less Than Actual Hours: Calculated the percentage of work orders where planned hours were less than actual hours.
% of Work Orders Planned Greater Than Actual Hours: Measured the percentage of work orders where planned hours exceeded actual hours.
Dashboard Visualization:

Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting to highlight deviations and trends.
Multi-Row Card Formatting: Designed multi-row cards to display key metrics.
Line Graph Trend: Added a line graph to show planning accuracy trends over time.
Work Type and Discipline Analysis: Included planning accuracy analysis by work type and discipline.
Top 10 Work Orders: Created a view of the top 10 work orders with the highest percentage difference between planned and actual hours.
